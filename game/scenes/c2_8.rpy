    sayadd marirusid neutral "Annie is next door.[pause] I need to talk to you, alone."
    marirusid "Based on what has been confirmed so far..."
    marirusid "Since this morning, many major cities have been hit by large-scale spacetime anomalies..."
    sayswap marirusid frown "By now, areas affected include Hovering Palace, Newmoridas, Masada Ford, Salmonton, New"
    marirusid "Opulentia and Lebona Islands."
    sayswap playerbat serious "That's practically...\nAll of the six major Academy Cities!"
    sayswap marirusid frown "Yup.[pause] It's got the whole world's attention now.[pause] A lot more areas have been affected than expected."
    marirusid "Don't take this the wrong way, but I suspect..."

    marirusid "Everything that happened in your dreams:\nterrorist attacks on the Research Center, whole cities in ruins..."
    marirusid "... Perhaps they were things that actually happened."
    sayswap playerbat worry "B-but... how could that be?"
    sayswap marirusid lecture "A large-scale dimensional warp is likely to have occurred this morning, although I have no definitive evidence."
    marirusid "SID's True Sight Satellite has also detected an unusual burst of noise."
    sayswap marirusid frown "Let's put it this way:[pause] New Opulentia was actually destroyed, but an unknown force reversed this reality..."
    marirusid "And this force seems to be linked to the changes in your body and the attack as well."
    sayswap marirusid neutral "But of course, this is only my assumption."
    sayswap playerbat worry "Uh, isn't that assumption a bit too bold...?"
    sayswap marirusid neutral "The other five Academy Cities are putting pressure on the Senate.[pause] They demand access to"
    marirusid "New Opulentia for investigation."
    marirusid "If your involvement comes out, it would be far worse than detention in research institutions..."
    sayswap marirusid smile "Agents of all intelligence services will label you as a key target."
    marirusid "More than a hundred secret agents entered New Opulentia today with forged documents--"
    marirusid "not to mention those already working undercover here."
    sayswap playerbat confused "You knew it?[pause]\nWhy don't you stop them?"
    sayadd marirusid neutral "Hm.[pause] Instead of showing our hand and forcing them to come up with a new strategy,"
    marirusid "isn't it better to stay in the shadows and work from behind the scenes?"
    sayswap marirusid lecture "You gotta understand, [playername], as long as you're still stuck in your female body,"
    marirusid "you can't go back to your old mundane life.[pause] Let that sink in."
    sayswap marirusid neutral "You're lucky, though.[pause] At least we at the SID were the ones who found you first."
    sayswap playerbat concerndrip "How do I even tell my classmates and friends... that I turned into a girl out of nowhere..."
    sayswap marirusid neutral "Umm... Aren't you worried about your parents?"
    sayswap playerbat casual "My mom died when I was small.[pause]\nMy dad... has been missing for years..."
    playerbat "I stayed in a boarding school before 12."
    sayswap marirusid smile "(... Gorilla man's post-war child care program did help some kids.)"
    sayswap marirusid neutral "You had a tough life, huh?[pause]\nAnyway, no need to worry about your current identity crisis."
    sayswap playerbat confused "Identity... crisis?"
    sayswap narrator "An ominous smile creeps onto Mariru's face..."
